Parallelized Feature Location using IPython Parallel
====================================================

Feature-finding can easily be parallelized: each frame an independent
task, and the tasks can be divided among the available CPUs. IPython
parallel makes this very straightforward.

It is simplest to try this on the CPUs of the local machine. To do this
from an IPython notebook, go to File > Open, and click the "Clusters"
tab. Fill in the "engines" field with the number of available CPUs
(e.g., 4) and click start. Now you are running a cluster -- it's that
easy. More information on IPython parallel is available in `this section
of the IPython
documentation <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/>`__.

.. code:: python

    from IPython.parallel import Client
    client = Client()
    view = client.load_balanced_view()

We can see that there are four cores available.

.. code:: python

    client[:]




.. parsed-literal::

    <DirectView [0, 1, 2, 3]>



Use a little magic, ``%%px``, to import trackpy on all cores.

.. code:: python

    %%px
    import trackpy as tp

Do the normal setup now, import trackpy normally and loading frames to
analyze.

.. code:: python

    import trackpy as tp
    
    def gray(image):
        return image[:, :, 0]
    
    frames = tp.ImageSequence('../sample_data/bulk_water/*.png', process_func=gray)

Define a function from ``locate`` with all the parameters specified, so
the function's only argument is the image to be analyzed. We can map
this function directly onto our collection of images. (This is a called
"currying" a function, hence the choice of name.)

.. code:: python

    curried_locate = lambda image: tp.locate(image, 13, invert=True)

.. code:: python

    view.map(curried_locate, frames[:4])  # Optionally, prime each engine: make it set up FFTW.




.. parsed-literal::

    <AsyncMapResult: <lambda>>



Compare the time it takes to locate features in the first ten images
with and without parallelization.

.. code:: python

    %%timeit
    amr = view.map_async(curried_locate, frames[:32])
    amr.wait_interactive()
    results = amr.get()


.. parsed-literal::

      32/32 tasks finished after    6 s
    done
    1 loops, best of 3: 6.89 s per loop


.. code:: python

    %%timeit
    serial_result = map(curried_locate, frames[:32])


.. parsed-literal::

    1 loops, best of 3: 13.7 s per loop
